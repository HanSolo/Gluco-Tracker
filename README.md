In case you run Gluco-Tracker with a Gluroo account, please fill in the Gluroo url in the Nightscout URL field
and the Gluroo API key in the token field.

The application was created to monitor the blood glucose values of our son. It also comes
with support for the Apple Watch. 
Because of restrictions from Apple we cannot continuously update the watch face on the Apple
Watch but only 50 times a day. Also the time of the updates is not guaranteed.
If you need to get the latest value on your watch you simply have to click on the complication
and tap the screen of the watch when the watch app opens.
A little green check mark will indicate that the value was loaded and is up to date, after that
you can press the digital crown to get back to the watch face and the current value should show
up in the watch face.

The application will also run on Mac OS X using Apple Catalyst. In case you would like to run
a similar application on the Mac in the system tool bar you might want to check out my other
application [Gluco-Status](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/gluco-status/id1527450184?mt=12) which only runs on OS X.
