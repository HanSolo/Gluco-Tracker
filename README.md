## Gluco-Tracker

An application that visualizes the blood glucose data coming from a nightscout server.

The application is written in Swift using SwiftUI and is available for iPhone, iPad.

[App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gluco-tracker/id1526976290?mt=8)


The application was created to monitor the blood glucose values of our son. It also comes
with support for the Apple Watch. 
On the Apple Watch, it is a separate application and won't show the values from the connected phone.
You can use the app even without the phone being around (in case you have an LTE enabled Apple Watch).
If you open the app on your Apple Watch, it will automatically load the latest value, otherwise you
can update it by tapping the display on your Apple Watch.
If you need to get the latest value on your watch you simply have to click on the complication
and tap the screen of the watch when the watch app opens.

Here are screenshots from the different application screens.

## HbA1c history chart
The Gluco-Tracker app will save the HbA1c once a day to your device. The HbA1c history
chart will show you the daily value for the last 365 days. The chart will be empty the
first time you start your app on your device because it has no values yet. Meaning to
say it will fill up over time.
